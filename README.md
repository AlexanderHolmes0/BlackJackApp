## Blackjack App
#Designed in Shiny with help from CardsJS. 
To get started press the Hit button. That will add one cookie to persistently save your points gained/lost on your browser.
More features to come in the future like card splitting and dealer reactions!

*Note:* If you have third-party cookies completely disabled then to gain persistent point storage you must turn them on for this site.

**As always have fun and more to come!**
