*Note:* If you have third-party cookies completely disabled then to gain persistent point storage you must turn them on for this site.

**Note about Note:** This isn't a malicious site, you're fine. I promise

**As always have fun!**

More features to come in the not so distant future
- hand splitting i.e. (two cards same value can get two separate hands)
- dealer reactions
- crypto 'donations' for coins (hehe)
- better background (currently dull AF, needs casino-like background)
